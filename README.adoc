Welcome to the mod.io Unreal Engine Component UI repository. The Component UI plugin provides UI components, a template Mod Browser, and editor tooling to allow UE developers to rapidly implement mod.io-aware mod browsing and other elements into their game's UI.  
It can be added either directly into existing screens or in dedicated browser and discovery sections.  

== Engine & Platform Compatibility

This plugin requires the core mod.io plugin to be installed alongside it. Support for both plugins is generally maintained to support the 3 most recent versions of Unreal Engine. 

=== Engine compatibility

|===
|Engine Version | Last Release
|UE5.2 | 2025.2
|UE5.3 | 2025.9
|UE5.4 | Current
|UE5.5 | Current
|UE5.6 | Current
|===


== Features

* UI-focused subsystem easing communication between UI elements and the core plugin
* Default UI component implementations that utilize the subsystem and visualize common mod.io data structures
* Interfaces and specifications to allow you to implement your own compliant components
* Template/reference implementation of a mod browser suitable for use as the basis of your own UI
* Permissive MIT/BSL-license

== Documentation
Comprehensive documentation for this plugin https://docs.mod.io/unreal/component-ui[can be found here].

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

. This plugin relies on the mod.io core plugin, available at https://github.com/modio/modio-ue. Please ensure you have downloaded, installed and configured the core plugin prior to installing the Component UI plugin. 

. To use this initial release of the Component UI plugin, you will need to remove our Legacy UE5 UI from the core plugin. Please delete the following folders from the core plugin's directories before proceeding:

	* Modio/Source/ModioUI
	* Modio/Source/ModioUICore
	* Modio/Source/ModioUIEditor
	* Modio/Content/UI5
. Please remove the ModioUI, ModioUICore and ModioUIEditor module elements from Modio/Modio.uplugin file

NOTE: The Legacy UE5 UI will be migrated to its own dedicated repository in the future - after that point, this manual cleanup will no longer be required. 

=== Adding plugin files to your project
==== As a git submodule

. Add this repository as a submodule to your repository in your project's `Plugins/ModioComponentUI` directory
+
In the directory with your .uproject file: `git submodule add https://github.com/modio/modio-ue-component-ui Plugins/ModioComponentUI`
. Initialize our submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`

==== In a non-git project, or without submodules

. Grab the latest release zip from the Releases section on this page, and extract the contents to your project's `Plugins/ModioComponentUI` directory

NOTE: The automatically generated zips on the release page and the 'Code' dropdown on this page will not work if this repository adds submodule dependencies in future releases. Please use the attached archive on the release instead.
