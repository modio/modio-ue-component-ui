The Template UI is a working, fully featured mod browser.

:::note
The Template UI is built using Component UI framework. For complete control over your UI implementation see the [**Component UI Documentation:**](/unreal/component-ui)
:::

It can act as a reference for experienced engineers to review when implementing the components into their own UI, or it can be used as a functional template right off the shelf for developers who don't have the time/resources to build their own mod browser. 

It's designed to be a user friendly interface that can handle all the base functions required in a mod browser for console and PC. Its visual design is clean and minimal, and it's built to be flexible enough for developers to easily modify to suit their needs.
