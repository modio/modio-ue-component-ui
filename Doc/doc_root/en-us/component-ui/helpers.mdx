## Subwidget component validators

The `UI/Components/ComponentHelpers.h` file provides a number of utility functions in the `ModioUI` namespace to simplify validating that a valid subwidget is being returned from a getter function:

```cpp
template<typename WidgetType = class UWidget, typename InterfaceType>
inline WidgetType* GetInterfaceWidgetChecked(TScriptInterface<InterfaceType> TargetWidget);

template<typename WidgetType = class UWidget, typename InterfaceType>
inline WidgetType* GetInterfaceWidgetAsDataSourceWidget(TScriptInterface<InterfaceType> TargetWidget);
```

They can be easily invoked as part of a conditional:

```cpp
if (UWidget* ImageWidget = ModioUI::GetInterfaceWidgetChecked(GetAvatarImageWidget()))
{
    // Make an interface call on ImageWidget using the interface type passed in to GetInterfaceWidgetChecked 
}
```

These functions use template deduction to infer the correct interface type from the `TScriptInterface` object you pass in, and will perform a more extended check than `TScriptInterface` normally does to accommodate pure Blueprint interface implementations as well. Using `GetInterfaceWidgetChecked` will mean you do not need to perform additional safety checks before invoking an `Execute_` method from an interface, which will normally throw an error if the target object does not in fact implement the required interface.

## Color references and property overrides

While primarily intended as implementation details of our template UI implementation, the plugin also provides the following helper structs:

- **`FLinearColorRef`**

    - This struct is a simple name-based reference to a color defined in a data table, to help implement palette support in the default mod.io components and template design. The default implementation looks colors up by name in a data table at a fixed location, but this can be altered by editing the definition of `ULinearColorRefLibrary::Resolve`.

- **`FIntegerOverride`, `FFloatOverride`, `FTextOverride`, `FInputActionOverride`, `FClassPathOverride`**

    - These are small helper classes to allow the default components to add properties at the Blueprint level which behave like they have an `EditConditionToggle/EditConditionHides/EditConditionInline` applied to a relevant bool. They make it easier to provide instanced overrides to class properties in a way that makes it very unambiguous something's being overridden. As with `FLinearColorRef`, each of these overrides has functional-style helpers defined in a Blueprint function library that avoid the need for divergent Blueprint logic based on an override being set, and simplify applying an override to a default value without having to add more conditional logic to your implementation.
